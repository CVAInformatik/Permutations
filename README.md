# Permutations
Permutation/Anagram Function

Program to generate permuation/anagrams of an inputstring in a systemic manner, with very little memory overhead. 
It is based on the fact that Sn ( the Symmmetric N group) is generated by the two permutations (1,2) and (1,2,3......,n-1,n)
A specification of a permutation is a string of numbers which is interpreted modulo n,  each meanning a <number>  cyclic rightward shift followed by a swap of the first two elements.

The main pprogram contains an example where we generate 100000 (almost, There will be the occasional duplicate) different permutations.
